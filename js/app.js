//connect 4 psudeocode
// 1) define variables used to track the state of the game (playerTurn, gameBoard, isWinner, etc ...)

// 2) store cached element references to connect javascript constants to elements on HTML page (gameBoard , gameMessage, whoseTurn)

// 3) create an initializing function to clear the board and neccisary state variables

// 4) create function render to apply changes to where in the gameBoard array the current player is going to drop their game piece.  Within this function i should have some logic that the game piece will go to the bottom of the column depending on if there is a game piece there or not. display a message for whose turn it is. prompt for player names

// 5) create a checkWinner function to check for winning combinations of 4.  I want to include an easteregg to check for 5 in a row

// 6) define constants. create draw function (gameBoard = !null) is a Tie

// 7) handle clicking a spot on the gameBoard. what color game piece to drop (turn)?  also add a timer to when each player is able to click to add more of a challenge for users

// 8) create a reset button that re-initializes the game state / board / variables
