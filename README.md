# connect-4
In Connect-4 you take turns against an opponent putting game pieces in a grid-style board to get four in a row.  It is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, but the main difference is that the grid is 6 by 7 and you can only choose to place your pieces in the 7 columns.  Your game piece will land on the next available open spot.  You can win by having pieces connect vertically, horizontally and diagonally
