# connect-4
In Connect-4 you take turns against an opponent by putting game pieces in a grid-style board to get four in a row.  It is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, but the main difference is that the grid is 6 by 7 and you can only choose to place your pieces in the 7 columns.  Your game piece will land on the next available open spot.  You can win by having pieces connect vertically, horizontally and diagonally.  I added optional music in the background and extra sound effects for when there is a winner.

I chose this game because it just something that my wife and I play when we go to Dave and Busters.  With all the stress and all the moving pieces in our lives, its nice to just nice to take a step back, go out once in a while to go out and play a game we used to play as kids.
